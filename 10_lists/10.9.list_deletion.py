# 10.9 List Deletion
'''
Using slices to delete list elements can be awkward and therefore error-prone.
Python provides an alternative that is more readable. The del statement
removes an element from a list by using its position.

As you might expect, del handles negative indices and causes a runtime error
if the index is out of range. In addition, you can use a slice as an index
for del. As usual, slices select all the elements up to, but not including,
the second index, but do not cause runtime errors if the index limits go
too far.

a = ['one', 'two', 'three']
del a[1]
print(a)

alist = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
del alist[1:5]
print(alist)
